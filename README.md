# SpOccSum (Species Occurrence Summary)

An easy-to-use Python tool to summarize species occurrence data from material examined lists in taxonomic revisions.

## Installation

You will need to have a current Python 3 installation to use SpOccSum. We recommend the Anaconda Python distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), which is available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.

With Python installed, you can simply run:

```
pip install spoccsum
```

This will install both the Python library and the command line interface.

## Command line interface

```
$ spoccsum summary -i microphontes_dwc.csv
```

```
$ spoccsum seasonal -i microphontes_dwc.csv
```
